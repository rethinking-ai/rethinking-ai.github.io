title: "Rethinking AI: Efficiency, Frugality, and Sustainability"
---

# Abstract

As Artificial Intelligence systems grow in complexity and scale, so do their environmental and societal impact. This workshop explores the urgent need for rethinking AI in terms of sustainability, with a focus on ecological and environmental issues. Presentations and discussions will rely on two pillars: 
*Sustainability in AI*, focused on reducing the ecological footprint of machine learning research and deployment, and *AI for Sustainability*, highlighting applications to global environmental challenges. With an emphasis on introspection of current practices, the workshop aims to foster responsible innovation, shared metrics, and encourage the community to design methods that are efficient, accessible, and viable with constrained resources.

# Important Dates

- **Submission Deadline:** October 10th, 2025, 23:59 AoE
- **Accept / Reject notification:** October 31st, 2025

# Call for Contributions

We invite submissions to the **Rethinking AI** workshop, which will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the dual challenges of applying AI for environmental preservation and making AI itself more environmentally responsible.

The workshop will feature **two complementary tracks**:

## Track 1: Sustainability in AI

We aim to discuss the *environmental footprint of AI itself*. We encourage submissions that address:

- Measuring and reporting the carbon, energy, and water footprint of AI models
- Algorithmic and hardware efficiency (compression, pruning, quantization, frugal AI)
- Lifecycle impacts of AI infrastructure (training, deployment, hardware production and disposal)
- Socio-technical and governance perspectives on responsible AI development
- Position papers reflecting on current research norms and proposing strategies for sustainable AI practices

## Track 2: AI for Sustainability

We also welcome work that demonstrates how AI can contribute to tackling urgent environmental challenges. Submissions may include, but are not limited to, applications of machine learning for:

- Climate science and modeling
- Biodiversity monitoring and conservation
- Agriculture and food systems
- Renewable energy and grid optimization
- Sustainable urban planning and mobility
- Resource management and the circular economy

## Submission Guidelines

- Submissions of **novel and unpublished work** should be **at least 2 pages**, **up to 4 pages** (excluding references and appendix) and following [NeurIPS formatting style](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers).
- **Published papers** can also be submitted in their original format, with the reviews included as supplementary material.
- We welcome *research papers, position papers, and case studies*. Accepted contributions are non-archival (not published in proceedings) and will be presented as posters, with selected works invited for short spotlight talks. We expect at least one author to present at the workshop.
